      <p className="text-base lg:text-md mb-4">
        I’m Rayvel Taruc, a passionate IT student focused on building dynamic and responsive web applications.
        My journey began with a fascination for how websites work, and it has since evolved into hands-on projects in web dev and cybersecurity.

      <p className="text-base lg:text-md mb-4">
        I specialize in using modern tools like React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS to build elegant, functional UIs. 
        I’m always learning and enjoy exploring both frontend and backend development.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base lg:text-md mb-4">
        I also enjoy experimenting with backend logic and simulating networks using Cisco Packet Tracer.
        I’ve participated in events like Hack4Gov and Code Wars to sharpen my problem-solving skills.
